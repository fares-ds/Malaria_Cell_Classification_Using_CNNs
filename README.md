# Classification of Malaria-Infected Cells Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Automation of the diagnosis process will enable accurate diagnosis of the disease and hence holds the promise of delivering reliable health-care to resource-scarce areas. Machine learning technologies have been used for automated diagnosis of malaria.[1](https://www.intechopen.com/books/machine-learning-advanced-techniques-and-emerging-applications/classification-of-malaria-infected-cells-using-deep-convolutional-neural-networks)

The issues associated with manual diagnosis present the case for automation of the malaria diagnosis process. The automation of the diagnosis process will ensure accurate diagnosis of the disease and hence holds the promise of delivering reliable health-care to resource-scarce areas. Hence, rural areas suffering from lack of specialized infrastructure and trained manpower can benefit greatly from automated diagnosis. Automating the diagnosis of malaria involves adapting the methods, expertise, practices, and knowledge of conventional microscopy to a computerized system structure.
